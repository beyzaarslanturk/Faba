#### This web page was a figma design and I tried to make pixel perfect this project. This project was completed using HTML , CSS , SASS and my purpose in making this project was to experience basic HTML, CSS, Figma and SASS features .
My achievements were:
- Creating main layout
- Flexbox
- Positions
- Creating navbar and main HTML attributes
- Responsive Desing ( There are some problems with media queries)
